# REST APIs

Historically, Heroku has exposed REST APIs to our customers.
For consistency sake, we intend to continue down this path for all public APIs at the moment.

Our (singular?) remaining public GraphQL API(s) will live on as long as needed, but will be replaced with a REST API.

This API design guide implies REST APIs through a number of principles.
Here, we're saying the obvious - we currently only document REST APIs and desire to only expose REST APIs.
